## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
example_code <- penguins %>% 
  mutate(Penguin_bill_surface_area = bill_length_mm * bill_depth_mm)
```

### Overall Summary

For the overall summary table, we will be using the `modelsummmary` package. It has the really cool feature that it will place histograms into your table! It is a very customisable package, with plenty of options to choose from for all sorts of analyses. For more information, please check their [website](https://modelsummary.com/index.html). 

```{r overall_table, echo=FALSE}

table <- df %>% 
  dplyr::rename( `Bill Length (mm)`= bill_length_mm , 
                `Bill Depth(mm)` = bill_depth_mm ,
                `Flipper Length(mm)` = flipper_length_mm ,
                `Body Mass(g)`= body_mass_g ) %>% 
  datasummary_skim(#, output = "flextable"
                 ) 
table

```




### By species
For the within group summaries, we are using the `gtsummary` package. This is another flexible table creator, which I find to be particularly useful and easy to use for subset summaries and analyses. For more information, check out their [website](https://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/).

```{r species_table, echo=FALSE}

table <- df %>%
  dplyr::rename(`Bill Length (mm)`= bill_length_mm ,
                `Bill Depth(mm)` = bill_depth_mm ,
                `Flipper Length(mm)` = flipper_length_mm ,

# d <- as.data.frame(df  %>% 
#   dplyr::rename(`Bill Length (mm)`= bill_length_mm ,
#                 `Bill Depth(mm)` = bill_depth_mm ,
#                 `Flipper Length(mm)` = flipper_length_mm ,
#                 `Body Mass(g)`= body_mass_g ) )
# #%>%
# datasummary_balance(~species, d #, output = "flextable"
#                  )
# d
```


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
